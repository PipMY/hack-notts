# TEAM 61 – REVELATION 23

## Hack Notts 2025

> *“They said someone was murdered in the lake last night…”*

---

## Overview

**REVELATION 23** is an interactive mystery experience built with **React**, blending investigative storytelling with a simulated chat interface. It follows the story of a local medival cult folling in the footsteps of the orgional Rosicrucianism cult, the player then has to help the police to find a hidden chatroom, but are you sure that your help is as honest as it seems.
Players uncover the truth behind a **medieval ritualistic murder** by observing a corrupted message feed between cult members and investigators.
The story unfolds in real time — with **randomised, fast message delays**, **accurate timestamps**, and a distinctive, unsettling aesthetic that evokes early-2000s chat logs, complete with **mini challenges** woven throughout.

---

## Core Features

* **Dynamic Chat Simulation** — Realistic typing sequences with randomised short delays to create an immersive sense of “live” messaging.
* **Authentic Timestamps** — Each line displays a realistic, incrementing timestamp throughout the conversation.
* **Modular Sequence Control** — Message sets are defined in JSON-like structures, easily editable for new scenes or branches.
* **Atmospheric Storytelling** — The narrative unfolds purely through dialogue and digital traces — no exposition, only discovery.

---

## Gameplay Concept

* **Genre:** Psychological Horror / Mystery
* **Perspective:** Observer — you are monitoring a live data feed or private group chat.
* **Goal:** Piece together the truth behind a cult’s final conversation before the murder night.
* **Player Interaction:** Primarily observation, with multiple small challenges to complete in order to locate and access the chat room.
